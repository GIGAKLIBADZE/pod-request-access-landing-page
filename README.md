## My process

I used mobile first workflow while building this project. Then I added/modified styles for tablet and desktop versions. Finally, I added some javascript code block for the desktop version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

After created many HTML/CSS projects, In this one I learned how to use JavaScript also. I got familiar with HTML input tag and some CSS features which were brand new for me.

Here is the one of them:

```css
/* Style user inputed text */
.email-input:focus,
.email-input:valid {
    font-size: 1.4rem;
    font-weight: 400;
    ...
}
```

### Continued development

Now, after building some markup projects, I am going to deeply learn JavaScript. Then I will continue constructing more complex project by using my new knowledge.
